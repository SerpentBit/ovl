## 2022.1.0 Changelog

### Added:

- `sharpening_kernel`
- Target Selectors for the `Director` now allows for more complex target selection, using a selector function, the
  default select `target_amount` of targets from the final targets (after filtration) still exists, now has an option of
  passing a tuple of a low and high bound (allows for selection of up to `target_amount` targets, and at least low but
  now more than high)
- Built-in colors are now bundled under the `HSV` class, still has the functionality of `HSV.red.convert` for easy
  usage.
- New camera configuration option, allows for systematic and automatic configuration of cameras using the new `CameraConfiguration`

    - `frc` installs `pynetworktables`
- Code examples
- Built in colors are now an enum called `HSV`
- `percent_area_filter` now uses 1 -> 1% instead of 0.1 -> 1%
