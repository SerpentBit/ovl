    Note: In Order to use NetworkTablesConnection you must have pynetworktables installed.
    (It is automatically installed when installing ovl)

    A connection to that uses NetworkTables (The FRC network protocol).

    NetworkTables are a group of Dictionaries (Hash tables) that are shared by all computers in the network.
    In the case of the FRC it is created by the RoboRIO and shared by other
    computers on the network like: the driver station, any connected coprocessor (like a raspberry pi) etc.

    NetworkTablesConnection creates defaults to writing to the Vision table.
    You can then read from /vision/vision_result the result sent.
